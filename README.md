## 💡 How We Came Up With the Idea

In today's fast-paced financial markets, misinformation spreads faster than facts — influencing prices, manipulating sentiment, and distorting public opinion. From viral tweets to deepfake videos, there's no reliable system for real-time verification of news content, especially in trading and finance.

We asked ourselves:
**What if there was a way to crowdsource truth, verify it transparently, and make sure markets respond only to facts — not fakes?**
That question led to **404-fake not found**.

## 🧨 The Problem

* 🚫 **Fake news affects markets**: Social media rumors and manipulated content can cause massive price swings.
* ⏱️ **No real-time verification layer**: Existing fact-checking is slow and often manual.
* 💰 **Traders act on noise**: Without tools to distinguish real from fake, misinformation becomes market-moving data.

---

## ✅ The Solution

**404-fake not found** creates a **community-driven, AI-augmented verification layer** that:

* Aggregates breaking news from X, YouTube, and web media.
* Summarizes and scores content using **AI + NLP**.
* Enables **users to stake TRUE tokens** and vote on whether content is real or suspicious.
* Stores all content and vote outcomes on **IPFS and Solana**, ensuring transparency and immutability.
* Rewards users for accurate verification and penalizes false validation.

## ⚙️ How Our Project Works

1. **News Aggregation**

   * Sources: X (Twitter), YouTube, online articles
   * Aggregated in real-time and processed for context.

2. **AI/NLP Processing**

   * Content is summarized.
   * Sentiment and market impact signals are extracted.

3. **User Verification System**

   * Users stake **10 TRUE tokens** to vote:

     * ✅ Verified (≥90% consensus): content is marked legitimate, and rewards are distributed to verifiers.
     * 🚫 Flagged (≥10%): content is removed, and rewards are sent to correct flaggers.

4. **Reputation System**

   * Users earn a **reputation score** for accuracy.
   * Higher scores unlock privileges like converting TRUE tokens to stablecoins.

5. **Token Flow**

   * Rewards cycle through users.
   * A small cut is recycled as protocol fees to support the platform.
